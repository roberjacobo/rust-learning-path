# rust-learning-path
This is my Rust learning path where you will find some examples that I'm adding while I'm learning.



### 1.- Hello World
- Simple Hello World without using cargo, I'm using a command so I can add the executable to the gitignore
### 2.- Hello World with cargo
- The same but using the Rustâ€™s build system and package manager: **Cargo**
### 3.- Guess Game (Quick Example)
- A small Rust example with a couple of elements that will be seen later
### 4.- Variables
- A couple of examples of using let, let mut, and const, plus a .md file with important information about data types.
### 5.- Shadowing
-
